    "46": "let's take look example line last example painting 2011 really count turning lines brush Strokes primarily secondarily maybe color third texture bunch lines sounds really fundamental look kind looks like maybe really close wolf fabric natural fiber know",
    "25": "show example shape piece hear one also last year see really form far three dimensional shading goes form implied using shapes top shapes intersecting shapes cutting shapes there's lot three dimensional depth without anything really actually three-dimensional kind two-dimensional",
    "29": "right rather value color seems pretty easy right pick color well want think want pick colors harmonize look good they're next grouped together video color theory watch give insight basically want use colors harmonious instance yellow complementary color",
    "8": "without going much detail use custom sponge throw texture even use square chalk brush along paper towel sure paint texture watch video text learn detail",

    "31": "aqua color colors important use important want throw colors randomly see artwork look good 7 example color would",
    "33": "gray kind Aqua kind green tent mentioned sorry complementary colors magenta opposite aqua kind happening kind almost perceiving gray color little bit opposite complementary color influenced know see example cuz there's colors",
    "18": "there's levels space space generally almost always used artwork know either fill page fill page going using space matter whether intentionally unintentionally generally used composition case diagram made used space everything kind less know centered there's certain amount space",

    "7": "canvas there's lots ways use texture texture really make something look like exists environment environment real especially good use digital art going make artwork look physical texture really easy use painter couple ways really quickly without going much detail use custom sponge",

    "36": "Grey's got wait mess people's heads looking art use color piece really focuses color trying send elements even though unintentionally there's spatial relations gray there's line there's texture things",

    "21": "divide canvas equal segments see running center words that's placed peacock's body everything else takes rest multiple uses space painting",
    "10": "things works really well closing put brown texture looks like dirt makes look really weathered really used done might really get point painting know person's really good condition",
    "19": "know centered there's certain amount space every kind know naturally however feel like know read instructions space things kind way help lot things naturally nice know they're aware take look space",
    "51": "one-by-one go know okay please text okay good use right worry automatically need inspiration know start something think one Concepts know start space generally easiest start figure everything going positioned",
    "6": "implying kind ammo texture even though really physically texture cuz screen however looks like texture texture could also actual physical texture could know texture clay sculpture texture oil painting canvas know traditional paintings canvas there's lots ways use texture",

    "28": "shape next one color colors straightforward deals huge year colors really easy pick Corel Painter key ring pick Hugh want fine-tune color however want we're going color right rather value color",
    "5": "people going look going show different examples use explain use work we'll start texture texture sometimes implied using different colors different values like hear implying kind ammo texture even though really physically texture cuz",
    "23": "next look shape kind similar form works form slightly different shape deals way like 2D form 3D shape kind Contour fill make look three-dimensional would kind",
    "27": "whole thing kind texture",
    "41": "lighter darker value balance ratio dark light everything middle creates contrast contrast enough things good especially realistic artwork practice monochromatic black white paintings get better really helps get good shading cuz thinking color much",
